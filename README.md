- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gavin 46 , Im a full time barber but im learning to code in my spare time,mainly at the weekends. I eventually want to change careers but im at the beginner stage at the moment.
- I started on the Odin project and got as far as JavaScript and then my laptop decided to mess with me! got it fixed but cant really use Linux on it so Im no longer able to continue with the Odin project!
- I have bought a few courses on Udemy and im currently working on them, mainly html css and javascript. I follow along with some projects too and put them here on github. Im also practicing on algorithms as I find them to be quite challenging. I will be starting a course here in Waterford Ireland next year, two times a week in the evenings. It will be comptuter basics ,I think this will help me in the future.
