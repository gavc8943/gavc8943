- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gavin 46 , Im a full time barber but im learning to code in my spare time,mainly at the weekends. I eventually want to change careers but im at the beginner stage at the moment.
- I started on the Odin project and got as far as JavaScript and then I bought some courses on Udemy that went into more detail on Javascript , more doing and less reading.
 I follow along with some projects too and put them here on github. Im also practicing on algorithms as I find them to be quite challenging. I completed the international computer driving license here in Waterford 
  Ireland this year. In February of this year I started a course with The Pitman Training Centre  and I am two modules away from completing it. This course includes : Computer and Technology Basics for Developers,
  Overview of Software Developement, Version Control, Visual Studio, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, JavaScript, Database and SQL, C# and .NET Framework Part 1 , C# and .Net Framework Part 2 and Project Management.
